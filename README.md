# Poor man's logging

Ever wanted just to log stuff with timestamps and 'descriptive' colors? No? Well, I did.

Quick and awfully dirty module I used a lot.

## Installing

`pip install git+https://github.com/nicovillanueva/poormanslogging` or just stick it into `requirements.txt`

## Configuring

Hahaha, no.
